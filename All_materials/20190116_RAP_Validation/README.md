# Coffee & Coding: RAP Validation

A demo looking at the early stages of developing a validation / QA system for ready-to-go tables in R, along with an overview of a RAP journey so far. The code is available here to read through (in both SQL and R) but unfortunately the raw data is confidential so cannot be provided.

However, the R script can be adapted to apply to any flat dataset. Script 01 is reliant on access to the data but subsequent scripts should be more easily adaptable.
