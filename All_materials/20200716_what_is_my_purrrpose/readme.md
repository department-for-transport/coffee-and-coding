Download this folder including all scripts and data at the link below. The link uses [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home) which may cause Chrome to flag a warning of serious threat to your computer. If you choose to proceed you can circumvent the warning by clicking on 'details' and then 'visit website'. It may also block the download, however you can still recover it by clicking on the three dots in the top right corner of Chrome and going to the Downloads folder where you will have the option to 'keep anyway'. If anyone finds a way of using DownGit and Chrome in harmony, do let me know.
