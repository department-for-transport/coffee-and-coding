# Writing a RAP package

*Rose McNally*

No code to download for this talk, just an HTML doc which goes through each of the steps for creating a package. 

To view the HTML doc online, click on the html file in this folder and copy the url. Then paste it in to [this page](https://htmlpreview.github.io/) and click *Preview*.

Any questions, please email rose.mcnally@dft.gov.uk, I am happy to help!
